        <div className="clue-background-title">Julius Echter</div>
        <div className="clue-background-div">Julius Echter was a strong representative of the Counter Reformation, bringing Catholicism back in the diocese of WÃ¼rzburg and expelling the Protestants. In addition, he is remembered for many other initiatives: he renewed the state legal system, led the diocese out of debt without taxes and re-established the university, which still holds his name today!</div>
        <div className="clue-background-div">However, he is not remembered only as an important administrative reformer but also as a great builder. One example is the building at the other side of the street that takes his name: Juliusspital.</div>
